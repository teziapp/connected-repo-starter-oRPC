### Phase 13: Performance Optimization ⚡

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Scale to 10,000+ users

#### Epic 13.1: Performance & Scalability

**Issues:**

**13.1.1: Add Database Indexes**
- Analyze slow queries (use pg_stat_statements)
- Add indexes on:
  - journal_entries(authorUserId, createdAt)
  - users(email)
  - subscriptions(userId, status)
  - user_schedules(userId, isActive)
- Add composite indexes where needed
- Test query performance improvement
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Slow queries identified
  - Indexes added
  - Queries 10x faster
  - No over-indexing

**13.1.2: Set up CDN for Static Assets**
- Configure Cloudflare CDN
- Upload static assets (images, fonts, icons)
- Configure cache headers
- Update asset URLs to use CDN
- Test asset delivery
- Monitor cache hit rates
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - CDN configured
  - Assets served from CDN
  - Page load 50% faster
  - Cache headers correct

**13.1.3: Implement Redis for Caching**
- Install Redis
- Install ioredis
- Cache user sessions
- Cache prompts (1 hour TTL)
- Cache user streaks (5 min TTL)
- Implement cache invalidation
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Redis configured
  - Sessions in Redis
  - API responses cached
  - Cache invalidation works
  - Reduces database load by 60%

**13.1.4: Optimize Frontend Bundle**
- Analyze bundle size (vite-bundle-analyzer)
- Implement code splitting
- Lazy load routes
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Tree-shake unused code
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Bundle size reduced by 40%
  - Initial load time <2s
  - Lazy loading works
  - Lighthouse score >90

## Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

### Known Limitations (OK for MVP)
- No Redis initially (sessions in PostgreSQL - migrate in V2)
- Basic conflict resolution for offline sync (backend wins)
- Simple daily prompt rotation (no ML personalization)

### Future Enhancements (V3+)
- AI-powered prompt personalization (based on user's writing)
- Voice journaling (speech-to-text)
- Rich text editor (formatting, images)
- Multiple journals/categories
- Social features (share entries with friends, prompts marketplace)
- Export to PDF with beautiful formatting
- Desktop apps (Tauri)
- Integrations (Notion, Obsidian, Day One)
- Analytics dashboard for users (word count, sentiment analysis)
- Habit tracking integration
- Mood tracking
- Journaling templates

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style (Enforced by Biome)
- **Formatting:** Tabs (NOT spaces), 100 char line width, double quotes
- **Types:** NO `any` or `as unknown` - use strict TypeScript
- **Imports:** Direct imports (NO barrel exports/index files)
- **Naming:**
  - camelCase for code
  - snake_case for database tables/columns
  - Descriptive IDs (`userId` not `id`, `authorUserId` not `authorId`)
- **Error Handling:** Throw standard errors - centralized error formatter converts to HTTP responses

### Git Workflow
- **Branches:** `main` (production), `develop` (staging), `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`
- **Commits:** Conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- **PRs:** Require CI passing, 1+ approval, no merge conflicts

### Testing Requirements
- **Backend:** >80% coverage on routers and critical logic
- **Frontend:** >70% coverage on components and pages
- **All PRs:** Must include tests for new features
